 <p>Let's learn about Pointer</p>
  <p>The pointer, one of the most significant features of C, is a variable that gets the value of the address of a variable. We initialize pointer with type, asterisk, and the name of pointer variable. When it says int *p, * means declaring pointer variable p. We also use & and ,unlike * that gives us the value that pointer has, this gives us the address of the pointer. But why do  we use pointer? As we use more and more variables, the program gets unnecessarily bigger and bigger. If we use pointer, it reduces the length of program and the runtime.
